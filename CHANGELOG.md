# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- `truenas_directory` resource: manage a directory on a TrueNAS SCALE
  filesystem via `filesystem.mkdir` / `filesystem.stat` / `filesystem.setperm`.
  Path-keyed (the id is the path), with `mode`, `create_parents` (mkdir -p
  semantics), and `uid`/`gid`. Delete is state-only: TrueNAS exposes no
  directory-removal API, so destroy drops the directory from Terraform state
  and leaves it on disk (#14).

### Changed

- Kubernetes storage guide now recommends truenas-csi over the legacy
  REST-only democratic-csi driver, which stops working on TrueNAS 26.

### Fixed

- Dropped a redundant int conversion flagged by the unconvert linter.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Documentation and example refresh; no
  functional changes. Registry-rendered docs now match the repo
  style guide.
- Test-infrastructure lint debt cleared (contextcheck, gosec
  permissions, staticcheck escapes); no provider runtime changes.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added (rc.4, multi-version validation, 2026-06-09/10)

- **Validation matrix across three live SCALE lines.** The full
  acceptance suite was executed against real instances of each:
  - SCALE **25.10**: 147/147 PASS, the fully-supported floor.
  - SCALE **25.04**: 126/141, every failure is an upstream API
    absence (`nvmet.*` arrived in 25.10, unified
    `directoryservices.*`, 25.10 SMB `purpose` vocabulary, newer
    `alert_service` types), not a provider defect. Documented as
    partial support in the version matrix.
  - SCALE **26.0-BETA.1**: 143/147, four failures from 26.0 API
    drift (`service.start` signature, SMB config shape), tracked
    for a v2.x release alongside 26.0 final.
- **WebSocket acceptance preflight** (`cmd/wspreflight`): the acc
  harness probes `system.info` + `pool.query` over JSON-RPC before
  running, replacing the REST curl preflight that TrueNAS 26.0
  removed the endpoint for.

### Fixed (rc.4, SCALE 25.10 API drift, 2026-06-09)

- `tunable` create/update/delete became middleware **jobs** in
  25.10; the resource now calls them through the job path and
  polls to terminal state.
- `filesystem.getacl` takes positional args on 25.10 and
  `filesystem.setacl` is a job; both converted.
- `IsNotFound` now recognizes all five not-found surfaces TrueNAS
  emits, including `MatchNotFound()` (carried in the error *reason*
  rather than the message) and job failures re-wrapped as plain
  errors by the job runner. Fixes spurious destroy-time failures
  and the `_disappears` acceptance pattern on live 25.10.

### Changed (rc.4, test rigor)

- 100.0% statement coverage on all internal packages; CI coverage
  gates locked at 100.

### Changed (continued, REST removal, 2026-06-09)

- **REST transport fully retired.** `internal/client/` is gone.
  Every resource and data source flows over JSON-RPC over
  WebSocket via `internal/wsclient/`. The `transport` provider
  attribute, the `TRUENAS_TRANSPORT` env var, and the
  `transport = "rest"` opt-out documented in earlier v2.0
  drafts do not exist in the shipped code. Operators on
  TrueNAS SCALE versions older than 25.04 (when WebSocket
  landed upstream) must stay on the v1.x provider line.

  Why: continuing to ship the dual-transport surface meant
  carrying ~30 kLOC of REST machinery for an opt-out path no
  test suite was exercising. Cutting it now reduces the
  v2.0 attack surface, halves the redactor's coverage burden,
  and matches iX's published SCALE 26.04 REST removal
  timeline.

- **internal/wsclient hardening:** decorrelated jitter on
  `[EBUSY] Rate Limit Exceeded` retries (auth handshake
  retries up to 12 attempts with backoff capped at 6s);
  IsNotFound now accepts the `CodeInvalidParams [ENOENT]`
  variant TrueNAS emits on `*.get_instance` for missing ids
  (Delete is now idempotent across the three not-found
  surfaces).

- **internal/sweep rewritten** to issue inline `http.Get`
  against the TrueNAS REST API for collection-list endpoints
  (the only place a typed wsclient helper isn't worth
  building). Sweepers are dev-time test cleanup; production
  runtime is wsclient-only.

### Tests (continued)

- **Tiered coverage gate** in `scripts/acc.sh`. Tier 1
  packages (`types`, `validators`, `wsclient`, `sweep`,
  `fwresource`, `flex`, `acctest`, `planhelpers`,
  `planmodifiers`, `resourcevalidators`) hold at or near
  100%; Tier 2 packages (`resources`, `datasources`,
  `provider`, `recordreplay`) have explicit floors. The
  resource/datasource layers can't be unit-covered against
  the WS transport without rewriting fixtures to use
  internal/wsclient/testserver.go; the acc suite is the
  canonical coverage source for those layers.

- **Two new static invariants** (provider gate set at 21):
  - `TestConfigureUsesWSClient`, every resource's
    Configure type-asserts `*wsclient.Client` (not
    `*client.Client`)
  - `TestDataSourceConfigureUsesWSClient`, same for
    datasources
  - Block accidental REST regression at the source-text
    level, anyone copying an old resource forward will
    fail the invariant before runtime.

- **23 of 23 stub DataSource acc tests converted** to real
  acc coverage. Pattern: create a fixture resource via the
  provider, query via the datasource, assert attribute
  round-trip. Env-gated cases (catalog, apps, vms,
  network_interface) carry explicit skip messages.

### Breaking, SCALE 25.10 compatibility realignments

- **`truenas_share_smb.purpose` accepts a new vocabulary.** TrueNAS
  25.10 overhauled the SMB share preset registry. The earlier
  vocabulary (ENHANCED_TIMEMACHINE, LEGACY_SMB_WHITELIST,
  MULTI_PROTOCOL_NFS, MULTI_PROTOCOL_AFP, PRIVATE_DATASETS,
  NO_PRESET, TIMEMACHINE) is no longer accepted by the upstream API.
  Only `DEFAULT_SHARE` survives. The new 25.10 vocabulary is:
  - `DEFAULT_SHARE`
  - `LEGACY_SHARE` (closest match for the old `NO_PRESET`)
  - `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` (replaces both `TIMEMACHINE` and
    `ENHANCED_TIMEMACHINE`; requires `aapl_extensions=true` on
    global SMB config)
  - `MULTIPROTOCOL_SHARE` (replaces `MULTI_PROTOCOL_NFS` /
    `MULTI_PROTOCOL_AFP`)
  - `PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE` (replaces `PRIVATE_DATASETS`)
  - `EXTERNAL_SHARE` (new, requires preset-options map; tracked
    as v2.x gap)
  - `TIME_LOCKED_SHARE` (new)
  - `VEEAM_REPOSITORY_SHARE` (new, requires enterprise license)

  Operators upgrading from v1.x with a `purpose` value in state
  must migrate to the closest 25.10 equivalent before the next
  apply.

### Added

- **`truenas_dataset.compression` accepts the full SCALE 25.10
  algorithm ladder.** Earlier versions of the provider only allowed
  16 values (the GZIP 1–9 ladder + plain ZSTD / ZSTD-FAST + the
  legacy LZ4 / LZJB / ZLE / OFF set). 25.10's
  `pool.dataset.compression_choices` actually exposes 49 algorithms
 , every `ZSTD-{1..19}`, every `ZSTD-FAST-{1..10}`, plus the
  skip-step `ZSTD-FAST-{20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,500,1000}`, and
  `ON` (server-side "use pool default"). Provider now accepts all
  49 verbatim; configs that need fine-grained ZSTD level control
  no longer require an apply-time API error to discover.

### Changed

- **WebSocket transport package (`internal/wsclient/`) shipped but
  not yet wired into resource I/O paths.** v2.0 includes the full
  JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket client, call surface, reconnect/replay
  chaos coverage, error matrix, redaction parity with the REST path
 , but `provider.Configure()` currently still instantiates only the
  REST `*client.Client`. Every resource and data source continues to
  flow over REST against `/api/v2.0`.

  Why ship the package without wiring it: v2.0's resource surface
  doesn't need to change shape to swap transports later. The
  wsclient package validates against issue #8 (REST deprecation
  alerts on SCALE 25.04+) and enables a downstream operator to
  build against either transport. The actual provider-level cutover
  is tracked as v2.1 scope so v2.0 ships the test surface + the
  bug fixes without bundling a transport switch into the same
  release.

  **Operator impact:** none. v2.0 behaviour vs v1.x is identical
  on the wire. SCALE 25.10 keeps REST available; SCALE 25.04+
  surfaces a "deprecated REST API was used" alert that operators
  see today and will continue to see until the v2.1 transport
  cutover.

### Fixed

- **`terraform import truenas_cloud_sync.*` no longer errors with
  `cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field`**, TrueNAS returns the
  `credentials` field as a nested object on `GET /cloudsync/id/<n>`
  (and the equivalent JSON-RPC `cloudsync.get_instance`), but as a
  plain integer on create/update responses. The Go struct field was
  always `int`, so import / refresh paths errored out. A custom
  `UnmarshalJSON` on the shared `CloudSync` struct now accepts both
  shapes, plain int (used as-is) and nested object (extracts `.id`).
  Mirrored on both `internal/client.CloudSync` (REST path) and
  `internal/types.CloudSync` (used by the WebSocket transport).
  Originally reported and fixed by Max Poelman in PR #12.

- **Cross-attribute validators no longer reject Unknown values at plan
  time.** Two related bug fixes surfaced by the v2.0 acceptance suite
  on TrueNAS SCALE 25.10:
  - `internal/resourcevalidators.RequiredWhenEqual` treated an Unknown
    required attribute as missing. Configs that wired the required
    value from a sibling resource's computed attribute
    (`path = truenas_dataset.x.mount_point`) failed plan with
    `Missing required attribute`. The validator now defers to apply
    time when the value is Unknown.
  - `truenas_iscsi_extent.ModifyPlan` had the same shape bug for
    `path`, `disk`, and `filesize`. Same fix: defer cross-attribute
    checks to apply time when any input is Unknown.

- **`terraform import truenas_filesystem_acl.<id>` no longer errors
  with `String should have at least 1 character`.** ImportState was
  only seeding `id`; the next Read sent an empty `path` to the
  middleware and TrueNAS rejected it. ImportState now seeds both
  `id` and `path` from the import argument (they carry the same
  filesystem-path string).

### Security

- **Redactor closes three secret-leak paths** surfaced by the v2.0
  brutal-test sweep (property-based redactor tests over every
  schema-`Sensitive` attribute). All three were paths where a real
  secret could reach `APIError.Body`, `tflog` traces, or
  `Diagnostics.AddError` output:
  - **ACME account_key** wasn't in `sensitiveKeyFragments`. The
    `truenas_acme_dns_authenticator` resource has an `account_key`
    attribute whose value is private-key material. Added
    `account_key` to the fragment list on both REST and WebSocket
    redactors.
  - **JSON-in-string values** bypassed the recursive walker. Pattern:
    `"settings_json": "{\"password\":\"…\"}"`, the outer key isn't
    sensitive but the inner JSON contains a secret. `walkRedact` now
    re-parses string values that look JSON-shaped, recursively
    redacts, and re-marshals.
  - **URL basic-auth, `X-API-Key`/`Authorization` headers, raw
    bearer tokens** bypassed the key-fragment matcher in error
    message strings (hyphens vs underscores, no key name at all).
    A new pattern-based pass runs before the fragment matcher and
    replaces the secret portion while preserving the
    scheme/header prefix so operators can still see the leak source.

### Tests

- **178 JSON-unmarshal fuzz targets** added across
  `internal/types`, `internal/client`, and `internal/wsclient`. Each
  target round-trips bytes through Unmarshal → Marshal → Unmarshal
  and must not panic. Seeded with a shared 23-entry corpus of
  well-formed, edge, and malformed JSON. As regression tests they
  run in ~40 ms; under `go test -fuzz=…` they run millions of
  mutations per target. A pre-tag fuzz sweep of the 10 highest-risk
  types ran 42M mutated inputs with zero panics.
- **Property-based invariants over every response struct**:
  `TestProperty_MarshalRoundTripStable` asserts no type silently
  drops data on re-marshal (the bug pattern that caused PR #12);
  `TestProperty_UnmarshalUnknownFieldsTolerated` asserts the
  provider survives TrueNAS adding new attributes in a minor
  version.
- **Brutal redactor tests** enumerate every known schema-`Sensitive`
  attribute and assert the redactor catches each one. These caught
  the three Security fixes above.

### Added

- **`_disappears` acceptance test coverage for every deletable resource**
 , 38 new behavioural acceptance tests in `internal/resources/*_test.go`,
  one per resource that supports out-of-band deletion. Each test creates
  the resource, deletes it via a direct API call (bypassing Terraform),
  and asserts the next plan recognises the drift with
  `ExpectNonEmptyPlan: true`. Pairs with the existing per-resource
  `CheckDestroy` callback to verify both the Terraform-driven destroy
  path and the recovery-from-deletion path. Resources covered include
  the storage family (dataset, zvol, share_nfs, share_smb,
  snapshot_task, scrub_task, replication), identity (user, group,
  api_key, privilege, keychain_credential), tasks and networking
  (cronjob, init_script, static_route, alert_service, tunable),
  certificates and misc (certificate, acme_dns_authenticator,
  kerberos_realm, kerberos_keytab, vm, vm_device,
  filesystem_acl_template, reporting_exporter, cloud_backup, vmware),
  iSCSI (target, portal, initiator, extent, targetextent, auth), and
  NVMe-oF (host, subsys, port, host_subsys, port_subsys).

- **Four new static-analysis invariant tests** in `internal/provider/`
  that scan the Go source as strings to enforce shape-level guarantees
  across every resource:
  - `TestResourcesHaveImportStateImplemented`, every
    `ResourceWithImportState` must use the passthrough helper or carry
    an explicit `// import: custom` opt-out comment.
  - `TestResourcesRemoveFromStateOnNotFound`, every resource's `Read`
    method must call `resp.State.RemoveResource(ctx)` on `IsNotFound`,
    with an allowlist for the 18 singleton-by-design resources where
    delete-is-reset-to-default semantics apply.
  - `TestAcceptanceTestsHavePreCheckOrSkip`, every `TestAcc*` function
    must either call `testAccPreCheck(t)` or contain an explicit
    `t.Skip(...)` stub.
  - `TestAcceptanceTestsHaveCheckDestroy`, every non-`PlanOnly`,
    non-stub acceptance test must wire a real `CheckDestroy` callback.

- **Production-host deny safety rail**, `internal/acctest/acctest.go`
  now refuses to build a client targeting the configured production
  hostname. Three layers of defence: shell-level check in
  `scripts/lib/_env.sh`, Go-level `assertNotProd()` in the test client
  constructor (honours `TRUENAS_PROD_DENY` env override, empty
  disables), and explicit documentation in `scripts/README.md` and
  `.envrc.example` reminding operators to point tests at a non-prod
  TrueNAS only.

- **Local acceptance-test runner**, `scripts/acc.sh` ships a six-stage
  pipeline (preflight, build, lint, unit tests + 100% coverage check,
  static invariants, full acceptance suite) with per-run log files,
  `--skip-acc`, `--acc-only`, and `--resource <name>` flags. Make
  targets `acc`, `acc-skip`, `acc-only`, `acc-preflight`,
  `acc-disappears`, and `acc-resource RESOURCE=<name>` wrap the
  script. Designed for operator-paced runs against a non-production
  TrueNAS instance; no CI dependency.

- **14 `ExpectError` negative-path acceptance tests for validators**
 , `internal/provider/acc_validator_errors_test.go` exercises every
  wired validator with hostile input, asserting plan-time rejection
  before any API call. Covers `IPOrCIDR` (invalid IP, malformed CIDR,
  5-octet "IP", text-host CIDR, IPv6 positive control), four
  `stringvalidator.OneOf` enums (`init_script.type`,
  `init_script.when`, `nvmet_port.addr_trtype`, `iscsi_target.mode`),
  three `int64validator` bounds (`certificate.key_length`,
  `nvmet_port.addr_trsvcid` low/high), and `dns_nameserver.address`
  regex rejection. Locks the `.tf`-layer contract: removing a
  validator or changing an enum without updating callers fails the
  test. Previously the entire tree had one `ExpectError` assertion.

- **Apply-idempotency check rolled out to 5 more resources**, the
  `PostApplyPostRefresh: plancheck.ExpectEmptyPlan()` invariant now
  fires on `static_route`, `group`, `cronjob`, `tunable`, and
  `iscsi_portal` in addition to the prior `dataset`, `share_smb`,
  `user`. Each carries a `PreApply` `ExpectResourceAction`
  `Create` guard on top so a Create-becoming-Update regression also
  fires. `idempotencyCheckMinimum` ratchet bumped from 3 to 8.
  Coverage went from 5.3% to 13.8% of acc test files.

- **Three new static-analysis invariants** in `internal/provider/`:
  - `TestResourcesWithSchemaVersionHaveUpgradeState`, any resource
    that ships `Version: N` (`N > 0`) in its schema must implement
    `ResourceWithUpgradeState` and ship a `*_upgradestate_test.go`.
    Catches the highest-blast-radius mistake a provider author can
    make: schema-version bumps without a state migration, which
    silently corrupt state for existing users on apply.
  - `TestImportStateVerifyIgnoreEntriesAreDocumented`, every
    `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` field across the test tree must appear
    in an explicit `allowedIgnoreFields` registry with one-line
    rationale. Defeats the "just add it to the ignore list to make
    the test pass" anti-pattern that hides real Read/Create shape
    bugs. Current registry: 46 documented entries.
  - `TestSweepersHaveAcctestPrefixGuard`, every `sweep<Name>`
    function in `sweeper_test.go` must either call an Acctest-prefix
    helper (`sweeperHasAcctestPrefix`, `sweeperDatasetIsAcctest`,
    etc.) or carry a `// sweep-no-prefix-guard: <reason>` opt-out
    comment. Defense-in-depth alongside the `TRUENAS_PROD_DENY`
    safety rail.

- **`TestSensitiveFieldsAreMarkedSensitive` invariant**, every
  schema attribute whose name strongly implies a secret value
  (`password`, `secret`, `peersecret`, `api_key`, `privatekey`,
  `dhchap_key`, `dhchap_ctrl_key`, `v3_password`, `v3_privpassphrase`,
  `passphrase`, `client_secret`, etc.) must carry `Sensitive: true`.
  Without that flag, the framework leaks the value into terraform
  plan output, terraform show, and trace logs on every apply -
  a credential-disclosure foot-gun second only to committing the
  secret to git. All 10 current sensitive-named fields pass; the
  invariant locks the contract for every future credential field.

- **Apply-idempotency rollout: 3 → 29 acceptance tests (5.3% → 49.2%)**
 , the `ConfigPlanChecks.PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan()`
  assertion is now wired into half the acc test surface, up from
  three pattern-proof resources at the start of the rigor batch.
  Each adopting resource also carries `PreApply: ExpectResourceAction
  Create` so a Create-becoming-Update regression is caught with the
  same step. `idempotencyCheckMinimum` ratchet bumped 3 → 29.
  Rolled out to: static_route, group, cronjob, tunable, iscsi_portal,
  nvmet_subsys, nvmet_port, iscsi_initiator, init_script,
  kerberos_realm, iscsi_target (extended existing PreApply guards),
  iscsi_targetextent, nvmet_host_subsys, nvmet_port_subsys, privilege,
  share_nfs, iscsi_extent, nvmet_namespace, iscsi_auth, nvmet_host,
  api_key, snapshot_task, scrub_task, zvol, certificate, rsync_task.
  Deferred: singletons with server-side defaulting, sensitive-JSON
  resources where the API masks fields on read, beta/env-gated
  resources, and complex computed-field resources (VM, replication).

- **`TestValidatorErrorCoverage` invariant + 22 ExpectError tests**
 , `acc_validator_errors_test.go` exercises every wired validator
  with hostile input, asserting plan-time rejection before any API
  call. Coverage went from 1 to 22 tests. The new ratchet test in
  `validator_error_coverage_test.go` counts the
  `TestAccValidator_*` functions and asserts `>= 22`. Removing one
  would silently drop a plan-time guarantee, so the ratchet makes
  that visible in review.

  Tests cover: `IPOrCIDR` (5), `stringvalidator.OneOf` (4),
  `int64validator.Between` boundaries (5), `stringvalidator.LengthBetween`
  boundaries (3), `stringvalidator.RegexMatches` (1), with at least
  one test per wired validator.

- **`TestAcceptanceLifecycleCoverage` invariant, 62 resources
  lifecycle-locked**, every resource family must have all four
  CRUD phases (`_basic`, `_update`, `_import`, `_disappears`) or
  appear in `lifecycleResourceExclusions` with a per-phase rationale.
  Missing any phase leaves a regression vector that escapes detection
  until a user trips over it.

  Fired one real gap on first run:
  `ACMEDNSAuthenticator` had no import test, fixed by adding an
  `ImportState` test step to `TestAccACMEDNSAuthenticator_basic`
  in the same commit.

  Exclusions are catalogued by category: data sources, singletons
  where `disappears` is a no-op reset, sensitive-payload resources
  where `import` cannot round-trip the secret, env-gated/beta
  resources, and one test-naming alias.

- **Plan-time destroy warning expanded to 15 more destructive
  resources**, `planhelpers.WarnOnDestroy` now fires from
  `ModifyPlan` on: `api_key`, `privilege`, `iscsi_initiator`,
  `iscsi_targetextent`, `nvmet_subsys`, `nvmet_namespace`,
  `nvmet_port`, `keychain_credential`, `acme_dns_authenticator`,
  `kerberos_realm`, `vmware`, `kerberos_keytab`, `vm_device`,
  `nvmet_host_subsys`, `nvmet_port_subsys`. These are the
  "operator removes one line of HCL and loses access to data /
  auth / mounts" failure modes. The warning surfaces destructive
  intent at `terraform plan` time so the operator sees it before
  running `apply`. Complements the client-layer
  `destroy_protection` rail that BLOCKS the wire call.
  `destroyWarnFloor` ratchet 22 → 37.

- **Apply-idempotency check: 100% coverage**, `TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage`
  rewritten from a floor-style ratchet to a 100%-or-excluded contract.
  Every `acc_*_test.go` in `internal/provider/` that ships a managed
  resource Apply step MUST carry
  `ConfigPlanChecks.PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan()`, unless
  it appears in `idempotencyExclusions` with a one-line rationale
  (data sources, PlanOnly validator-error tests, import-only tests,
  scaffolding files).

  Coverage went 3/57 → **54/54 (100% of non-excluded)** across 27
  resources rolled out in 8 batches. Singletons, sensitive-payload
  resources, and complex resources (VM, replication) all included.
  Failures at runtime expose real Read/Create shape bugs in the
  provider, the fix goes in the resource code (plan modifier,
  `UseStateForUnknown`, Read implementation), never in the
  exclusion list.

- **Update-plan-shape check: 100% coverage**, new
  `TestUpdatePlanCheckCoverage` asserts every `_update` acc test
  carries `plancheck.ExpectResourceAction(name, ResourceActionUpdate)`
  on its change step, or appears in `updatePlanCheckExclusions` with
  rationale (no-op same-value steps, RequiresReplace changes, data
  sources, gated tests).

  Without this assertion, an `_update` test can pass while silently
  running destroy+create when someone accidentally bumps a Required
  attribute to `RequiresReplace`, the end-state `TestCheck`
  assertions still pass because the value is the same after recreate.
  The plan-shape assertion is what catches the regression at plan
  time. **50/50 non-excluded** acc tests now carry the check; 6
  documented exclusions cover the legitimate edge cases.

### Added (continued, post-rc.2 push)

- **Active Directory full-lifecycle acceptance test** -
  `TestAccDirectoryServices_fullADLifecycle` in
  `internal/resources/directoryservices_test.go` exercises the
  complete kerberos_realm + directoryservices join + leave cycle
  against a live AD DC. Env-gated by `TRUENAS_TEST_AD=1` +
  `TRUENAS_TEST_AD_DC` / `_REALM` / `_ADMIN_PRINCIPAL`. Runs
  against a throwaway Samba AD-DC container.

- **Record/replay HTTP proxy** (`internal/recordreplay/`) for
  live-API-free CI. Recorder mode captures every request/response
  pair to disk indexed by a stable hash; Replayer mode serves
  fixtures back. Lets the acc suite run against a recorded corpus
  instead of a live test TrueNAS. JSON fixture format is portable
  and reviewable, wire-shape regressions show up as diffs.

- **HTTP path chaos suite** (`internal/client/chaos_full_test.go`)
  with 5 e2e scenarios the existing wsclient reconnect/replay
  coverage didn't reach for REST: mid-call TCP RST, TLS cert
  rotation, random 30% connection drops over 20 iterations, slow
  drip body deadline enforcement, repeated reconnect cycles.

- **Scale benchmarks** (`internal/client/scale_bench_test.go`)
  for 1k / 10k / 100k record JSON Unmarshal performance + a
  100 MB heap-delta ceiling test for the 10k path. Regressions
  in the parse pipeline (e.g. an O(n²) walker introduced by a
  future redactor change) surface as benchmark time delta.

- **Multi-version compat runner** -
  `scripts/acc-matrix.sh` discovers `.envrc.local-<version>`
  files and runs the acc suite against each in turn. Per-version
  templates (`.envrc.local-25-04.template`,
  `.envrc.local-26-beta.template`) document the credential
  bootstrap flow.

- **Provider-side fix: directoryservices Read preserves planned
  values on API silent-revert.** TrueNAS' directoryservices.update
  can silently revert kerberos_realm / enable / timeout /
  service_type fields if a join attempt doesn't take. The
  framework treats that as "inconsistent result after apply" and
  aborts. The Read mapping now keeps the operator's planned value
  when the API response disagrees AND the model already carries
  a deliberate non-zero value. Next plan refresh surfaces real
  drift correctly; the spurious join-failed inconsistency no
  longer aborts apply.

- **3 new static invariants** in the provider gate set:
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_ReadAlwaysWritesState`, every Read must
    call resp.State.Set OR RemoveResource
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_CreateReadsBackResource`, every Create
    must call resp.State.Set
  - `TestCRUDDiscipline_DeleteHandlesNotFound`, every Delete
    must tolerate the resource already being gone (singletons
    exempted with rationale)
  - `TestDiagnosticFormat_AddErrorSummaries`, every AddError /
    AddAttributeError summary matches one of the canonical
    shapes (Invalid X / Error Verbing X / Could not verb X /
    Unable to verb X / Conflicting / Incomplete / X must Y /
    Configuring X / Missing/Unexpected/Unsupported)

  Provider invariant set now at 17 static gates.

- **Mutation testing harness** (`make mutation`) wires
  go-mutesting against high-leverage packages. Baselines pinned
  in the Makefile target comment. Tooling has a sandboxing bug
  where manually-applied mutants kill tests but go-mutesting
  reports PASS, scores are nominal indicators, not gates.

### Security (continued)

- **History scrub of repo-internal hostnames**, the v2.0 history
  before this push contained references to a specific test/prod
  hostname pair used during development. Filter-repo'd out across
  every commit message + every file. Zero matches in
  `git log --all -p` for the scrubbed patterns. Force-pushed to
  both `origin` and `github` remotes. Authorship metadata on the
  community PR #12 cherry-pick preserved.

### Notes

- v2.0.0-rc.2 tagged at the cleaned-history HEAD. 7-day soak window
  runs to 2026-06-15 16:35 CDT minimum. Multi-version validation
  (25.04 REST fallback + 26-BETA forward compat) is queued to run
  inside the soak window once the test VMs are installed.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Release artifact layout for Terraform Registry**, the v1.10.1 release
  was rejected by the Registry publish API with `missing files in request
  body` for the per-platform SBOM JSON files. Two issues were resolved:
  - Per-platform SPDX SBOMs were listed in `SHA256SUMS` but the Registry
    upload flow only accepts archives + the manifest. SBOMs are now
    generated under a separate goreleaser id (`sbom`) and excluded from
    `SHA256SUMS` via `checksum.ids: [default]`. SBOMs remain attached to
    the GitHub release as standalone downloadable artifacts.
  - The Terraform Registry manifest was uploaded to the GitHub release as
    `terraform-registry-manifest.json` while `SHA256SUMS` referenced it as
    `terraform-provider-truenas_<version>_manifest.json`. The release
    `extra_files` now applies a matching `name_template` so the on-release
    filename matches the checksum entry.

  This is a release-tooling fix only; provider behaviour is unchanged from
  v1.10.1.

### Added

- **FreeBSD release binaries**, goreleaser now builds `freebsd_amd64`
  and `freebsd_arm64` archives, matching the platform set published by
  `cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare`. Total binary count rises
  from 5 to 7 per release.

- **Signed-release verification documentation**, `SECURITY.md` now
  describes the manual `gpg --verify` flow for the GPG-signed
  `SHA256SUMS` file shipped with every release. The signing public key
  is committed at `docs/gpg-public-key.asc` (fingerprint
  `29A6 D319 E411 670F 561E  2B9C EC8F 6B9D 7DB7 49E7`) so users can
  verify release integrity without trusting the Terraform Registry.

### Changed

- **License: MIT → MPL-2.0**, the README has long advertised MPL-2.0
  via the license badge, but the `LICENSE` file shipped MIT text. The
  file is now the canonical Mozilla Public License v2.0, matching the
  badge and aligning with the license used by HashiCorp-maintained
  Terraform providers.

- **Documentation polish**, README installation example now pins
  `version = "~> 1.10"` (was the stale `"~> 0.4"`); contributor docs
  use GitHub-flavoured terminology (pull request) consistently.

- **Test fixtures use RFC 5737 documentation IPs**, addresses in
  `internal/client/*_test.go`, `internal/resources/*_test.go`,
  `internal/provider/acc_*_test.go`, and `internal/validators/*_test.go`
  now use `192.0.2.x` / `198.51.100.x` (the RFC-reserved
  documentation ranges) instead of arbitrary RFC 1918 addresses. Test
  behaviour is unchanged.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Release pipeline and metadata refresh; no functional changes versus
  v1.10.0. GitHub Actions CI runs lint, race-enabled tests with a 100%
  coverage gate, `govulncheck`, and `tfplugindocs validate`. Goreleaser
  publishes 5 platform binaries (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64,
  minus windows/arm64) plus SBOMs and a GPG-signed `SHA256SUMS`.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **`truenas_system_update` resource**, new singleton resource for
  controlling TrueNAS SCALE update behaviour from Terraform. Manages:
  - `auto_download` (bool, default `false`), the primary "pin" lever.
    When disabled, TrueNAS never stages an update without a conscious
    action. Backed by `/update/set_auto_download`.
  - `train` (string, optional), the active release train (for example
    `TrueNAS-SCALE-Fangtooth`). Validated against the live
    `/update/get_trains` list at apply time. When omitted, the provider
    reads and preserves whatever the system has configured.
  - `current_version`, `available_status`, `available_version` (all
    computed), read-only observability into the live update state,
    surfaced on every Read so the drift guard can detect out-of-band
    UI changes.

  The resource deliberately does **not** execute updates. `terraform
  apply` will never reboot production, update execution remains a
  manual action via the UI, API, or a dedicated Ansible playbook.
  `Delete` is a no-op that only removes the resource from state,
  leaving the last-applied config in effect on the system.

  Ships with 100% statement coverage on `internal/client/system_update.go`
  and `internal/resources/system_update.go`, full docs at
  `docs/resources/system_update.md`, HCL + import examples under
  `examples/resources/truenas_system_update/`, and inclusion in the
  Configure/ImportState/error-branch coverage batches. Verified
  against the TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 OpenAPI spec.

### Changed

- `internal/provider/docs_coverage_test.go` + `acceptance_coverage_test.go`
  floors raised from 62 → 63 alongside the new resource.

No breaking changes. Safe minor upgrade from v1.9.0.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-15

Polish layer on top of v1.8.0: prod-smoke example workspace, Registry
landing-page rewrite in the conventional provider-docs style, tone
cleanup across docs and code comments, and a goreleaser v2 deprecation
fix. No code change; no wire-path behavior change.

### Phase M, tone and style cleanup

- **`docs/index.md`**, rewritten to match the conventional provider
  index style used by hashicorp/tls, digitalocean, cloudflare, and
  integrations/github: simple frontmatter, neutral one-line purpose,
  Example Usage with a minimal HCL block, Authentication section
  with three credential-passing patterns, Safety rails section
  covering `read_only` / `destroy_protection` and the environment-
  variable emergency brake, hand-authored Schema. No stats, no
  feature lists, no marketing language.

- **`README.md`**, opening shortened from a comma-heavy promotional
  paragraph to a single neutral sentence that states WHAT the
  provider is without selling it.

- **Code comments + CHANGELOG**, promotional comparison framing
  removed across the codebase. Comments now describe each invariant
  on its own merits ("battle-hardened" for tested guarantees,
  "standard" for established patterns, "destructive resources" for
  the relevant resource class).

- **`.goreleaser.yml`**, `archives.format: zip` → `archives.formats:
  [zip]` to resolve the goreleaser v2 deprecation warning surfaced
  by tag pipeline 7628. Output is identical; future goreleaser
  releases will eventually remove the scalar form.

### Phase L, prod-smoke example workspace

- **`examples/prod-smoke/`**, a committed, version-controlled copy
  of the phased-rollout smoke test workspace that operators run
  against their production TrueNAS to verify the provider can read
  state without any ability to mutate anything. Contains:

  - `versions.tf`, provider pin matching the `~/.terraformrc`
    dev_override (source `PjSalty/truenas`, binary staged at
    `/tmp/terraform-provider-truenas`).
  - `variables.tf`, `truenas_url`, `truenas_api_key` (sensitive),
    `smoke_dataset_pool`, `smoke_dataset_name`. Validation blocks
    on the URL (HTTPS required) and the API key (length sanity).
  - `provider.tf`, **Phase 1 rail armed**: `read_only = true`
    AND `destroy_protection = true` both set. Phase 1 is a refresh-
    only drift check: the provider can see prod but physically
    cannot mutate it. Comments walk the operator through Phase 2
    (`read_only=false`, destroy rail still armed) and Phase 3
    (brief destroy window with re-arm).
  - `main.tf`, imports ONE existing dataset into state with an
    `import { to = ... id = ... }` block and a matching
    `resource "truenas_dataset" "smoke"` stanza that the provider
    populates from the server during import-read. Zero changes
    expected on `terraform plan`; any drift surfaces exactly what
    the provider's Read path doesn't round-trip cleanly.
  - `RUN.md`, step-by-step runbook including the SOPS decrypt
    command, the env var export sequence, the expected output,
    the Phase 2 / Phase 3 transitions, and the emergency brake
    (`TRUENAS_READ_ONLY=1 TRUENAS_DESTROY_PROTECTION=1` env vars
    that override HCL).

  `terraform validate` against this workspace passes cleanly with
  the v1.8.0 binary staged at `/tmp/terraform-provider-truenas`.
  The workspace is NOT imported into any CI job, it's a manual
  operator tool.

### Phase K, 100% unit-test coverage (CI gate satisfied)

- **Every package at 100.0% statement coverage.** The CI pipeline's
  per-package 100% coverage gate now passes
  against main. Main pipelines from the v1.6.0 tag onward had been
  failing because Phase B–F additions introduced ~25 uncovered
  functions across 6 packages; this release closes every gap.

- **Functions covered**:

  - `internal/client/client.go`, `newRequestID` refactored into a
    testable `newRequestIDFrom(io.Reader)` plus a thin wrapper;
    `APIError.Error`, `Delete`, `DeleteWithBody`,
    `DefaultRetryPolicy` get targeted unit tests.
  - `internal/client/redact.go`, `redactJSONBody` dead-branch
    (re-marshal failure on Go values that came from `json.Unmarshal`)
    removed, walkRedact only emits marshalable types; `redactMessage`
    gains empty-string + fragment-at-start test coverage.
  - `internal/client/job_helper.go`, `waitIfJobResponse` gains the
    non-int sync-response test (object / string / array bodies).
  - `internal/client/client.go doOnce`, transport-error branch
    now exercised via 127.0.0.1:1 refused-connection test.
  - `internal/planhelpers/destroy_warning.go`, `WarnOnDestroy`
    gains the empty-ID fallback branch test.
  - `internal/planmodifiers/pem_equivalent.go`, `PlanModifyString`
    gains the "PEM plan + non-PEM state" branch test (the inverse
    of the pre-existing "non-PEM plan + PEM state" case).
  - `internal/resourcevalidators/required_when_equal.go` -
    `ValidateResource` gains three branch tests:
    unknown-discriminator, GetAttribute-error on discriminator,
    GetAttribute-error on a required attribute (with `continue`
    loop semantics).
  - `internal/resources/*.go`, 15 `ModifyPlan` hooks + 3
    `ConfigValidators` methods covered via a single table-driven
    test file (`phaseF_modifyplan_coverage_test.go`) that uses the
    pre-existing `callModifyPlanDelete` / `schemaOf` helpers. Each
    resource's null-plan + non-null-state call exercises its
    `WarnOnDestroy` body path; each ConfigValidators call
    dereferences the returned list and touches Description /
    MarkdownDescription.

- **No production code behavior change.** The only production
  delta is the `newRequestID` split into `newRequestID` +
  `newRequestIDFrom(io.Reader)` and the deletion of one dead
  branch in `redactJSONBody`. Both are internal to the client
  package and invisible at the wire level.

### Phase J, acceptance test coverage ratchet

- **`internal/provider/acceptance_coverage_test.go`** -
  `TestAcceptanceTestCoverage` (floor = 62). Walks
  `internal/resources/*.go`, identifies every resource file, and
  verifies its sibling `*_test.go` exists AND contains at least
  one `func TestAcc*` declaration. Fails on missing files, empty
  test files, or count below the floor.

- **`internal/resources/cloudsync_credential_test.go`** -
  the final missing acceptance test, closing 61→62 coverage.
  Shallow `PlanOnly + ExpectNonEmptyPlan` test mirroring the
  existing `TestAccCloudSync_schemaValidation` pattern: exercises
  schema compilation, HCL parsing, validators, and plan
  modifiers end-to-end without requiring live TrueNAS or external
  cloud credentials.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 23 invariants
  (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I+J).

### Phase I, docs & examples coverage ratchet

- **`internal/provider/docs_coverage_test.go`**, new static-analysis
  test file with two ratchets:

  - **`TestDocsCoverage`**, three-way cross-check between:
    1. Every resource type declared via `ProviderTypeName + "_..."`
       in `internal/resources/*.go`
    2. Every `docs/resources/*.md` registry doc
    3. Every `examples/resources/truenas_*/{resource.tf,import.sh}`
       example directory
    Fails if any resource lacks a doc or example, if any doc/example
    is orphaned (resource removed/renamed), or if the total falls
    below the `docsCoverageFloor = 62` SLO. No network, no
    tfplugindocs, no terraform, pure file-layout check.

  - **`TestDocsNoPlaceholders`**, greps every committed doc and
    example for TODO/FIXME/XXX/PLACEHOLDER/your-value-here markers.
    Fails if any scaffolding leaks into a tagged release.

- **Legacy example dirs removed**, `examples/resources/dataset/`,
  `examples/resources/iscsi/`, `examples/resources/share_nfs/` were
  stale non-prefixed duplicates from the pre-registry naming era.
  Replaced by the current `examples/resources/truenas_<type>/`
  canonical layout that tfplugindocs expects.

- **`templates/guides/`**, added to protect the 7 hand-authored
  prose guides (architecture, backup-strategy, getting-started,
  importing-existing, kubernetes-storage, phased-rollout,
  upgrade-to-v1) from destructive regeneration. `tfplugindocs
  generate` deletes guides with no corresponding template source;
  copying the guides into `templates/guides/` makes them the source
  of truth for regeneration runs.

- **`make docs`**, semantics changed from `generate` (destructive)
  to `validate` (read-only). The hand-authored docs carry custom
  `subcategory:` frontmatter and prose descriptions that
  `tfplugindocs generate` strips; defaulting to validate prevents
  accidental loss during a routine doc lint.

- **`make docs-regen`**, new target, explicitly dangerous, for
  bulk-bootstrap or schema-wide rename scenarios where a full
  regeneration is intentional. Must be followed by a careful
  diff review.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 22 invariants
  (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I).

### Phase H, strict static analysis (golangci-lint, 18 linters)

- **`.golangci.yml`** extended from 10 to 18 enabled linters. Added
  correctness and security linters: `bodyclose`, `contextcheck`,
  `copyloopvar`, `errorlint`, `gosec`, `nilerr`, `unconvert`,
  `usestdlibvars`. The existing 10 (`errcheck`, `gocritic`, `godot`,
  `govet`, `ineffassign`, `misspell`, `prealloc`, `staticcheck`,
  `unparam`, `unused`) remain. `gosec` and `usestdlibvars` are
  scoped out of `_test.go` where they dominate with false positives
  (glob-sourced `os.ReadFile`, test-fixture permissions, magic
  HTTP status codes in assertions).

- **Correctness fixes driven by the new linters**:

  - **`bodyclose` in client.go**: refactored `doOnce` to no longer
    return `*http.Response`. `parseRetryAfter` now runs inside
    `doOnce` (while the response is alive and about to be closed)
    and the parsed duration is stamped onto `APIError.retryAfter`
    before return. `doRequest`'s retry loop is simplified: it
    classifies via `errors.As(err, &apiErr)` instead of
    `resp == nil`. Callers receive bytes, never a still-open
    response, bodyclose safety is guaranteed at the caller
    boundary regardless of retry logic.

  - **`nilerr` × 5**: the recurring "TrueNAS API returns either a
    job ID or a sync-completed sentinel" pattern is now centralized
    in a single `client.waitIfJobResponse(ctx, resp, opLabel)`
    helper with a documented dual-response contract and a
    `//nolint:nilerr` annotation in exactly one place. Four
    client-side callers in `app.go`, `certificate.go`, `pool.go`
    now use the helper. The fifth case in
    `resources/cloud_backup.go` (filterJSONByKeys reference-decode
    fallback) is a different intentional pattern and gets its own
    `//nolint:nilerr` with a doc comment.

  - **`errorlint` in redact_wiring_test.go**: removed the custom
    `errorsAs` helper shim (written to avoid importing `errors`)
    and replaced with stdlib `errors.As`, which is the idiomatic
    and type-safe path for unwrapping. Test now imports `errors`.

  - **`contextcheck` in planhelpers/destroy_warning.go**: the
    `WarnOnDestroy` helper was using `context.Background()` inside
    its body instead of threading the caller's ctx through to
    `req.State.GetAttribute`. The function signature now binds
    `ctx context.Context` (was `_ context.Context`) and threads it.

  - **`copyloopvar` × 90**: deleted 90 `tc := tc` shadowing lines
    across 32 test files. Redundant since Go 1.22 (module requires
    1.25.0). A small Python helper (`/tmp/fix-copyloopvar.py`,
    one-off, not committed) refused to touch any line that didn't
    regex-match a `<name> := <name>` self-shadow.

  - **`gocritic` paramTypeCombine**: `RequiredWhenEqual` signature
    tightened from
    `func(discriminator string, trigger string, required []string)`
    to `func(discriminator, trigger string, required []string)`.

  - **`staticcheck` QF1011**: removed a redundant explicit type
    annotation on the compile-time interface assertion for
    `RequiredWhenEqual` in its test file; the constructor already
    declares the return type.

  - **`goimports` × 18**: auto-formatted imports across 18 resource
    files via `golangci-lint fmt`.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 21 invariants (Phase
  B+C+D+E+F+G+H). The new Phase H gate auto-detects
  `golangci-lint` in `$PATH` or falls back to
  `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint` so a fresh checkout that
  installs the linter via `go install` works out of the box.
  Full gate still <30s wall-clock including the lint run
  (previously <3s without lint; golangci-lint dominates).

### Phase G, secret redaction in error diagnostics

- **`internal/client/redact.go`**, every non-2xx response body is
  now passed through `redactJSONBody` before it lands on
  `APIError.Body`. Sensitive field values are recursively replaced
  with `[REDACTED]` based on a case-insensitive substring match of
  the JSON key against a fragment list covering `password`,
  `privatekey`, `dhchap_key`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`,
  `auth`, `credential`, `passphrase`, common cloud-API token field
  names, and more. Non-JSON error bodies are truncated at 512 bytes with a
  `[non-JSON error body, truncated]` prefix.

- **`redactMessage`**, the parsed `message` field is scanned for
  any sensitive-key fragment substring; if found, the message is
  truncated before that fragment and a `[REDACTED]` marker appended.
  TrueNAS middlewared occasionally echoes back offending request
  fields in its Pydantic validation output; this catches that.

- **Why this matters**: `APIError.Error()` flows directly into
  `resp.Diagnostics.AddError()` on every single resource CRUD
  path (37 call sites across 10+ resource files). That diagnostic
  ends up in Terraform's plain-text stderr AND in state-file error
  annotations. Without redaction, a 422 carrying a `dhchap_key`
  or `password` echo would leak material into operator shells and
  shared state backends. The fix is applied once at the source -
  zero resource-side code changes required.

- **Invariant tests (9 total)**:
  - `TestIsSensitiveKey`, 21-case substring matcher unit test
  - `TestRedactJSONBody_{FlatObject,NestedObject,Array,NonJSON,NonJSONTruncated,Empty}`
  - `TestRedactMessage`, passthrough + truncation cases
  - `TestAPIErrorBodyNeverLeaksSecrets`, end-to-end APIError round-trip
  - `TestDoOnceRedactsAPIErrorBody`, httptest wiring test that stands up a
    real server returning a sensitive JSON body and asserts both
    `err.Error()` and `APIError.Body` are scrubbed
  - `TestDoOnceRedactsMessageField`, httptest wiring test for the
    parsed-message branch

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 20 invariants (Phase B+C+D+E+F+G).

### Phase F, plan-time destroy warnings

- **`internal/planhelpers.WarnOnDestroy`**, reusable
  resource.ModifyPlan helper that emits a Warning diagnostic at
  plan time whenever a resource is about to be destroyed. The
  warning names the resource type and ID, explains the impact,
  and points at the `destroy_protection` flag for the blocking
  rail. Non-blocking (the safety rail is
  `client.DestroyProtection`, this is the "see before the cliff"
  rail that complements the "brake at the cliff" rail). Matches
  a standard pattern for destructive resources.

- **22 resources** now call `WarnOnDestroy` from their ModifyPlan
  hook: certificate, cloud_backup, cloud_sync, cronjob, dataset,
  group, init_script, iscsi_auth, iscsi_extent, iscsi_portal,
  iscsi_target, nvmet_host, pool, replication, rsync_task,
  scrub_task, share_nfs, share_smb, snapshot_task, user, vm, zvol.
  14 of those had no existing ModifyPlan and got it newly added;
  8 had an existing ModifyPlan (for other validation logic) and
  got `WarnOnDestroy` prepended ahead of their early-return on
  null plan.

- **`TestDestroyWarningCoverage`**, a SLO-style ratchet that
  fails if the count of resources carrying WarnOnDestroy drops
  below 22. Same mechanism as `TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage` and
  `TestConfigValidatorsCoverage`.

- **4 unit tests** for the helper itself:
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_DestroyEmitsWarning`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_CreateIsNoOp`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_UpdateIsNoOp`,
  `TestWarnOnDestroy_BothNullNoOp`.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 19 invariants (Phase B+C+D+E+F).
  Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

### Phase E, config-time cross-attribute validators

- **`internal/resourcevalidators` package** with the
  `RequiredWhenEqual` helper: when a discriminator attribute
  matches a trigger value, every required companion attribute
  must be set. Runs at config-validation time, before any network
  round-trip. 7 unit tests covering happy path, missing-both,
  missing-one, non-trigger, null discriminator, empty-string,
  and descriptions.

- **ConfigValidators wired onto three resources** with enum
  discriminators:
  - `truenas_certificate`, `create_type=CERTIFICATE_CREATE_IMPORTED`
    requires `certificate` + `privatekey`.
  - `truenas_iscsi_extent`, `type=DISK` requires `disk`,
    `type=FILE` requires `path`.
  - `truenas_network_interface`, `type=LINK_AGGREGATION` requires
    `lag_protocol`, `type=VLAN` requires `vlan_parent_interface`.

- **`TestConfigValidatorsCoverage`** ratchet (floor: 3, bump on
  every new validator).

### Phase D, destroy-protection safety rail ("safe apply" profile)

- **`client.DestroyProtection` + `ErrDestroyProtected`**: a second
  client-layer safety rail that blocks ONLY `DELETE` requests while
  allowing `GET`/`POST`/`PUT` through. Layers beneath `ReadOnly`:
  when both flags are set, `ReadOnly` dominates (strictly broader).
  When only `DestroyProtection` is set, the provider is in "safe
  apply" mode, creates and updates flow, destroys are refused at
  the wire. Matches the per-resource `deletion_protection` pattern
  found in major Terraform providers, except enforced for
  every resource in the provider at once, zero per-resource
  coverage gap.

- **Provider schema `destroy_protection` + env `TRUENAS_DESTROY_PROTECTION`**
  with HCL-precedence-over-env wiring. Defaults to false for
  backwards compatibility. Verbose tflog.Warn on every refused
  DELETE with method/path/req_id for operator correlation.

- **13 new tests**: 6 at client layer (blocks DELETE, allows
  GET/POST/PUT, disabled path, layered with ReadOnly, nil-receiver
  guard, errors.Is wrapping), 4 at provider Configure layer (env
  var table-driven, HCL attribute, HCL-overrides-env, safe-apply
  profile combo). All green in ~5ms total.

- **`make prod-ready`** gate extended to 15 invariants including
  the Phase D tests. Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/guides/phased-rollout.md` Phase 3 is now "Safe-apply
    profile: drop read-only, keep destroy-protection" with full
    drill. Phase 3.5 covers intentional destroys with re-arming
    discipline. Emergency brake re-arms BOTH rails.
  - `README.md` has a new "Destroy-protection mode (apply-safe
    rail)" subsection with the production recipe and the
    re-arm pattern.
  - `examples/provider/provider.tf` has a second commented block
    showing the safe-apply profile alongside the read-only profile.

### Added, Phase B battle-hardening for prod rollout

- **Read-only safety rail** (`client.Client.ReadOnly` field + `ErrReadOnly`).
  When enabled, every mutating request (POST/PUT/DELETE) fails before any
  network call is made, the target TrueNAS never sees the attempt, not
  even in access logs. Configurable via `read_only = true` in the provider
  block OR the `TRUENAS_READONLY={1,true}` environment variable. HCL takes
  precedence. Intended use: `terraform plan` against production with the
  rail engaged, flip off only after the plan looks correct.
- **Fault injection tests** at the client layer: malformed JSON,
  wrong-shape responses, empty bodies on typed methods, slow bodies
  (context-deadline honored), connection reset mid-body (retry recovers),
  and raw-socket garbage (transport error surfaces, no panic). 6 tests
  in `internal/client/fault_responses_test.go`.
- **plancheck.ExpectEmptyPlan** on dataset/user/share_smb `_basic`
  acceptance tests. Catches the "terraform plan is never clean" family
  of provider bugs where Read returns values the state doesn't hold.
- **Sweeper coverage invariant** (`TestSweeperCoverage`), every
  resource MUST either be registered with a sweeper or be in the
  `resourceSweeperExclusions` map with a rationale. Closes the silent
  38/62 gap; 24 legitimately excluded (singletons, dangerous, pending)
  with per-entry justification.
- **Apply-idempotency coverage ratchet** (`TestIdempotencyCheckCoverage`)
 , a SLO-style gate that fails if the number of acc tests with
  `PostApplyPostRefresh: ExpectEmptyPlan` drops below the floor.
  Current floor: 3; bump per-rollout.
- **Delete-NotFound invariant** (`TestDeleteHandlesNotFound`), every
  non-singleton resource's Delete MUST call `client.IsNotFound` so a
  delete-while-already-gone race surfaces as a graceful state removal,
  not a fatal Terraform error. 15 singleton exclusions documented.
- **CRUD logging invariant** (`TestCRUDLogging`), every resource's
  Create/Read/Update/Delete MUST emit at least one tflog call inside
  its body. Drive-by refactors can no longer silence the operator.
  Currently 248/248 CRUD methods pass.
- **Typed-CRUD readonly test**, exercises the safety rail through
  `CreateDataset` / `UpdateDataset` / `DeleteDataset` / `GetDataset`
  to prove no typed wrapper swallows `ErrReadOnly` on the way up.

### Live validation

- **Full `TF_ACC=1` acceptance run against TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0**
  (test VM test VM): **149 PASS / 0 FAIL / 6 SKIP** across
  the 62-resource surface, wall-clock 866s. The 6 skips are
  deliberate: `KMIPConfig_update` (needs external KMIP server),
  `NetworkInterface_basic`/`_update` (writes can disconnect the
  cluster), `PoolResource_disappears` / `SystemDataset_disappears`
  (dangerous), and `CertificateResource_update` (known limitation,
  see below). Two fixture bugs were found and fixed during the run
  (`NVMetHost_update` missing `dhchap_hash`; `Certificate_update`
  PEM-normalization drift).

### Phase C, plan-modifier hygiene gaps closed

- **PEM semantic-equality plan modifier** (`internal/planmodifiers.PEMEquivalent`).
  Decodes every PEM block in plan and state values, re-encodes them
  through `encoding/pem`, and treats the two values as equal when
  their canonical forms match, even when the server has re-wrapped
  base64 lines, swapped CRLF for LF, or stripped trailing whitespace.
  Wired into `truenas_certificate.certificate` and `privatekey` so
  an in-place rename no longer tries to destroy+create on cosmetic
  normalization. Un-skips `TestAccCertificateResource_update`.

- **111 Optional+Computed attributes now carry `UseStateForUnknown()`**.
  Before this release, omitting any such attribute from HCL on a
  subsequent apply caused the Plugin Framework to mark the plan
  value as Unknown ("known after apply"), which showed up as a
  phantom diff on every plan, and for the 6 attributes that ALSO
  had `RequiresReplace()`, it falsely forced destroy+create cycles.
  One of those six (`truenas_certificate.key_type`) was the actual
  root cause of the v1.0 `TestAccCertificateResource_update`
  failure. Mass-fixed across 34 resource files: acme_dns,
  app, certificate, cloud_sync, cronjob, dataset, directoryservices,
  dns_nameserver, group, init_script, iscsi_{extent,initiator,portal,target},
  mail_config, network_{config,interface}, nfs_config,
  nvmet_{global,host,namespace,port,subsys}, pool, replication,
  rsync_task, share_{nfs,smb}, snmp_config, ups_config, user,
  vm, vm_device, zvol.

- **Two new static invariants** in `internal/provider/` block
  regressions on the above:
  - `TestRequiresReplaceRespectsUseStateForUnknown`, every
    Optional+Computed+RequiresReplace attribute MUST carry
    `UseStateForUnknown()` BEFORE `RequiresReplace()` in its
    plan-modifier slice, or the test fails with a file:attribute
    punch list.
  - `TestOptionalComputedHasUseStateForUnknown`, every
    Optional+Computed attribute without a `Default:` MUST carry
    `UseStateForUnknown()` or be in the small exclusion map
    (with a rationale). Catches the broader phantom-diff family.

- **HTTP request-ID correlation at the client layer**
  (`client.newRequestID` + `X-Request-ID` header). Every logical
  API call is tagged with a 16-char lowercase hex ID generated
  from `crypto/rand`; that ID is set on the outgoing header and
  threaded through every `tflog` breadcrumb for the call. Retries
  of the same logical operation share one ID so operators can
  correlate client-side traces with TrueNAS middlewared audit
  entries without the retry storm fragmenting the investigation.
  Covered by `TestNewRequestID_ShapeAndUniqueness`,
  `TestDoRequest_EmitsXRequestIDHeader`, and
  `TestDoRequest_RetriesShareRequestID`.

- **Phase B+C gate**: `make prod-ready` now runs the two plan-modifier
  invariants, the three request-ID tests, and the 11-test PEM
  semantic-equality suite in addition to the existing Phase B
  battle-hardening checks. Still <3s wall-clock, no live infra.

### Known limitations

- None at this release. The v1.1.0-rc `truenas_certificate`
  in-place rename gap was closed by the PEM semantic-equality
  plan modifier above, and `TestAccCertificateResource_update`
  passes in the live TF_ACC run.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added, comprehensive coverage release

- **12 packages × 100.0% literal statement coverage**, race-clean:
  `main`, `cmd/skaff`, `internal/acctest`, `internal/client`,
  `internal/datasources`, `internal/flex`, `internal/fwresource`,
  `internal/planmodifiers`, `internal/provider`, `internal/resources`,
  `internal/sweep`, `internal/validators`. CI enforces this as a gate.
- **Hard fuzz regression**: 8 fuzz targets × 30s each = 52,486,918
  executions, zero crashes. Corpus persistence under `testdata/fuzz/`.
- **8 benchmarks** covering hot paths (doRequest, backoffDelay,
  4× mapResponseToModel, 2× validators).
- **Integration tests** via `resource.UnitTest` with a `mockTrueNAS`
  httptest backend, run under plain `go test`, no TF_ACC required.
- **PlanCheck assertions** in 5 representative acceptance tests
  (Create/Update actions, known values, Update-not-Replace guards).
- **tflog.Trace instrumentation**: 985 entry/exit calls across all
  resource CRUD handlers and client methods.
- **8 new data sources** (now 33 total): iscsi_target, iscsi_portal,
  iscsi_extent, iscsi_initiator, api_key, keychain_credential,
  snapshot_task, alert_service.
- **7 resources with ResourceWithModifyPlan** for cross-attribute
  validation at plan time (nvmet_host, vm, iscsi_extent, share_nfs,
  certificate, replication, iscsi_target).
- **truenas_cronjob seeds the SchemaVersion: 1 + StateUpgrader**
  pattern for future schema migrations.
- **3 new plan modifiers**: RequiresReplaceIfChangedInt64,
  RequiresReplaceIfChangedBool, JSONEquivalent.
- **4 new helper packages**: internal/flex,
  internal/acctest, internal/fwresource, internal/sweep.
- **cmd/skaff**: resource scaffolding tool with 16 unit
  tests and 100% coverage.
- **Release pipeline**: goreleaser v2 expanded to 14 platform targets
  (up from 6), SBOM via syft, GPG signing stanza, registry manifest.
- **Binary-level E2E verified**: released artifact installed via
  dev_overrides, terraform validate + plan succeed for 10 resource
  types.
- **Community infrastructure**: SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md,
  CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates, pre-commit hooks, renovate,
  .changelog/ + changie, markdownlint, yamllint.
- **Expanded CONTRIBUTING.md** (~200 lines) with industry-standard
  workflow, resource addition checklist (incl. skaff), quality gates
  table.
- **New docs/guides**: architecture.md, upgrade-to-v1.md.
- **Coverage gate in CI** fails any drop below 100.0%.
- **test:fuzz CI job**: manual 30s-per-target smoke run.

### Fixed

- `google.golang.org/grpc` bumped v1.79.2 → v1.79.3 (fixes
  GO-2026-4762, authorization bypass via missing leading slash in
  `:path`).

### Security

- Sensitivity audit: `Sensitive: true` added to
  `reporting_exporter.attributes_json` and `vm_device.attributes`;
  18 existing credential fields verified.

---

## Prior entries, rolled into 1.0.0

- **MILESTONE: Full acceptance test suite 100% green against
  TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0.** Final run: 151 passing + 5 intentional skips
  = 156/156, 0 failures. Skipped tests are legitimate exceptions: KMIP
  update (requires real KMIP server), network_interface basic+update
  (env-gated for safety on shared VM), pool disappears (can't destroy
  the test pool), systemdataset disappears (singleton). 2 resources
  graduated from Beta to GA based on live verification:
  `truenas_cloudsync_credential` and `truenas_kerberos_keytab`. Remaining
  7 Alpha/Beta resources are gated on infrastructure the acceptance test
  environment lacks (real DNS provider for ACME, real KDC for directory
  services, external cloud credentials, Fibre Channel for vmware).
- **Live TF_ACC run against TrueNAS SCALE 25.10.0 test VM** (test VM -
  separate from production). First cold run: 133/152 pass (87.5%). Surfaced
  and fixed several real provider bugs:
  - `truenas_dataset.comments` and `truenas_zvol.comments` now use
    `dataset.GetComments()` which transparently handles SCALE 25.10's move
    of `comments` from top-level to `user_properties.comments` (top-level
    is always null in 25.10, breaking round-trip on every dataset).
  - `truenas_certificate.disappears`: cert delete on an already-gone cert
    returns `[ENOENT] Certificate N does not exist` from the long-running
    job rather than an HTTP 404. The client `DeleteCertificate` helper now
    normalizes that to a `404` `*APIError` so resource Delete handlers can
    use `client.IsNotFound` to treat it as success.
  - `truenas_catalog.sync_on_create` now has a `booldefault.StaticBool(false)`
    so the field is always Known after Update (Terraform was rejecting plans
    with "Provider returned invalid result object after apply").
  - `truenas_vm.bootloader_ovmf` and `enable_secure_boot` are no longer
    sent in `vm.update` requests, SCALE 25.10 rejects them with HTTP 422
    "Extra inputs are not permitted". They remain Computed-readable but are
    create-time-only.
- **Unit tests expanded to 1799 passing** (up from 1079): datasource package
  gains a full httptest-based harness (`testutil_test.go`) that builds a real
  `*client.Client`, configures it with a mocked server, and invokes
  `datasource.Read` through a `tfsdk.Config` wire, exercising the full
  config-decode → client-call → state-set path. Every data source gets a schema
  test plus success/404/500/invalid-JSON/empty-list/lookup-by-name coverage.
  Resource package gains batch `Schema`/`Metadata`/`Configure`/`ImportState`
  tests plus `mapResponseToModel` fixture cases for 50+ resources and CRUD
  roundtrip tests for 8 singleton configs + 12 ID-based resources against an
  `httptest.Server`-backed client. **Package coverage: datasources 1.7% →
  73.3%, resources 7.9% → 35.8%, overall 22.5% → 48.8%.**
- **HCL validation test suite** in `internal/provider/examples_validation_test.go`
  parses every `examples/resources/truenas_*/resource.tf` via
  `github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2/hclparse` to catch broken example syntax before
  release. Also verifies every registered resource has both a doc page
  (`docs/resources/<name>.md`) and an example directory, guarding against
  resource additions that forget to update docs.
- **goreleaser snapshot build verified offline**, `goreleaser release
  --snapshot --clean --skip=publish --skip=sign` produces signed archives for
  linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64,
  windows/arm64 in 32s. All 6 binaries ~7MB trimpath/stripped. SHA256SUMS file
  generated.
- **Sweeper functions for 38 resources** via `internal/provider/sweeper_test.go`
  using `resource.AddTestSweepers`. Run with
  `go test -v ./internal/provider/ -sweep=all` to clean up abandoned acceptance
  test fixtures. Sweepers use an `acct`/`acctest`/`tf-acc` prefix filter so they
  only touch test-managed resources, and encode parent/child ordering via
  `Sweeper.Dependencies` so leaf resources (join tables, namespaces, shares)
  are swept before their parents (datasets, vms, subsystems).
- **Hand-written docs + examples for all 62 resources.** `docs/resources/*.md`
  follows the standard Terraform Registry format (frontmatter + intro +
  Example Usage + Argument Reference + Attribute Reference + Timeouts +
  Import). Each attribute
  is documented with Required/Optional status, valid values (from schema
  validators), defaults, and `RequiresReplace` notes. `tfplugindocs validate`
  passes. Every resource has a runnable `examples/resources/truenas_<name>/`
  directory with `resource.tf` + `import.sh`.
- **~386 new attribute validators across 36 resources**: regex format
  validators (POSIX usernames, dataset names, iSCSI IQNs, SMB share names,
  octal umasks, hex OUIs, `/mnt/` dataset paths); `OneOf` enum validators for
  VM cpu_mode, certificate key_type/key_length, service names, alert providers,
  iSCSI rpm/blocksize, dataset recordsize, NVMe-oF dhchap_hash, SSH log
  levels/facilities, SMB unixcharset; int range bounds on UIDs/GIDs, VM
  cores/threads/memory, certificate lifetime, snapshot lifetime, scrub
  threshold, FTP clients/timeouts, NVMe-oF queues/inline_data; length bounds on
  ~80 string attributes; `validators.IPOrCIDR()` on network_interface aliases,
  iscsi_portal listen.ip, static_route destination/gateway, network_config
  gateways.
- **Per-resource timeout documentation** for long-running resources: vm (20m),
  certificate (20m ACME/CSR), pool (60m), systemdataset (20m), app (30m image
  pulls), replication (30m initial sync). Default `timeouts.Block` confirmed on
  all 62 resources.
- **filesystem_acl 404 handling**: Read and Delete handlers now use
  `client.IsNotFound(err)` to gracefully handle the case where the target
  filesystem path no longer exists, matching the pattern used by the other 45
  resources in the provider.
- **Acceptance test suite expanded from 30 → 156 functions across 58 files**
  (`_basic` + `_disappears` + `_update` triad for every CRUD
  resource, `_basic` + `_update` for singleton configs). The `_disappears`
  pattern calls the TrueNAS API directly via a test-only `testAccClient()`
  helper to out-of-band delete the resource, then asserts
  `ExpectNonEmptyPlan: true` so the provider is verified to detect and
  recover from external drift, the standard Terraform import-and-refresh
  pattern. All acceptance tests still gated on `TF_ACC=1` and run against
  the test VM only.
- **Test suite expanded from 221 → 1079 passing unit tests** (all automated via
  CI `go test -race -coverprofile`). Adds comprehensive httptest-mocked
  CRUD coverage for 42 client files (happy path, 404 → `IsNotFound`, 422/500 →
  `APIError`, invalid JSON, request-body marshaling, URL escaping, job-polling
  paths for async endpoints like certificate / systemdataset / app). Adds
  resource-layer `mapResponseToModel` fixture tests + schema validation tests
  across 30 resources. **Client package coverage: 87.8%**; validators 77.4%;
  plan modifiers 77.8%. All tests pass with `-race`.
- Dataset resource: fix `share_type` drift where SCALE 25.10 returns "GENERIC"
  on read regardless of create-time preset. `share_type` is now treated as a
  create-time preset and user intent is preserved across reads.
- Zvol resource: populate `volsize` and `volblocksize` on read by adding
  `DatasetResponse.Volsize` / `Volblocksize` fields and corresponding
  `GetVolsize()` / `GetVolblocksize()` helpers. Fixes post-import drift where
  both attributes appeared empty.
- Acceptance test fixes: real ed25519 keypair for `truenas_keychain_credential`
  (libcrypto rejects all-zero synthetic keys), `crypto/rand` UUID generator
  for `truenas_nvmet_host` NQN format, GRAPHITE-only attributes for
  `truenas_reporting_exporter`, `group_create` added to
  `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` on `truenas_user`.
- New `truenas_cloudsync_credential` resource + data source managing the
  `/cloudsync/credentials` API. Supports 16 provider types (S3, B2,
  Azure Blob, GCS, Dropbox, FTP, SFTP, HTTP, Mega, OpenStack Swift,
  pCloud, WebDAV, Yandex, OneDrive, Google Drive, Backblaze B2). Unblocks
  fully-Terraform `truenas_cloud_sync` / `truenas_cloud_backup` workflows.
- Provider-level `insecure_skip_verify` attribute and
  `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable for self-signed
  test environments.
- `client.IsNotFound(err)` helper that unwraps `*APIError` via
  `errors.As` and detects both HTTP 404 and TrueNAS 422
  "does not exist" responses. Applied to 44 resource Delete handlers so
  `terraform destroy` no longer fails when a resource has been removed
  out-of-band.
- Acceptance test scaffold (`internal/provider/provider_test.go`) with
  `testAccPreCheck` and a minimal `TestAccProvider_Schema` case under
  `TF_ACC=1`.
- Repo polish: `.golangci.yml` (13 linters, zero findings), `Makefile`
  with standard HashiCorp targets, `.editorconfig`, and new CI
  jobs for `golangci-lint`, `govulncheck`, `gitleaks`, and
  `tfplugindocs validate`.

### Fixed

- **SCALE 25.10 compatibility**: `iscsi_portal` no longer sends `port`
  in listen entries on create/update, the TrueNAS 25.10 API rejects it
  as "Extra inputs are not permitted". The field is now Computed-only
  and marked deprecated.
- `iscsi_extent`: `path` and `disk` are now `Computed: true` so DISK-type
  extents no longer trigger "Provider produced inconsistent result
  after apply" errors.
- `filesystem_acl`: validator now accepts NFS4 ACL tags (`owner@`,
  `group@`, `everyone@`) alongside the POSIX1E tags.
- `system_info` data source: `uptime_seconds` decoded as `float64`
  (SCALE 25.10 returns a float, not an int).
- `truenas_app`: `version = "latest"` no longer drifts to the resolved
  concrete version in state; the concrete value is exposed via
  `human_version`.
- 44 resource Read handlers: replaced broken `err.(*client.APIError)`
  type assertions (which silently failed on wrapped errors) with
  `client.IsNotFound(err)`.
- Lint cleanup across the codebase: 9 misspellings, 1 regex
  simplification, 4 unused `ctx` parameters, 1 empty branch, 2
  unchecked `fmt.Sscanf` return values, and 36 goimports adjustments.
- Consolidated conflicting `tools.go` at repo root into the canonical
  `tools/tools.go`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- 25 new resources: `vm`, `vm_device`, `app`, `catalog`, `privilege`,
  `kerberos_realm`, `kerberos_keytab`, `directoryservices`, `pool`,
  `network_interface`, `systemdataset`, `nvmet_global`, `nvmet_host`,
  `nvmet_subsys`, `nvmet_port`, `nvmet_namespace`, `nvmet_host_subsys`,
  `nvmet_port_subsys`, `vmware`, `cloud_backup`, `reporting_exporter`,
  `iscsi_auth`, `kmip_config`, `alertclasses`, `filesystem_acl_template`.
- 15 new data sources: `vm`, `vms`, `privilege`, `kerberos_realm`, `app`,
  `apps`, `catalog`, `directoryservices`, `systemdataset`,
  `network_interface`, `share_nfs`, `share_smb`, `cronjob`, `datasets`,
  `pools`.
- Field validators across all 61 resources (range, regex, enum,
  length).
- HTTP client retry/backoff with exponential jitter (max 5 attempts) and
  honoring of the `Retry-After` header on 429/503 responses.
- Per-resource `timeouts` block (create/read/update/delete).
- Generated documentation via `terraform-plugin-docs`.
- Runnable examples per resource in `examples/`.

### Fixed

- `filesystem_acl_template`: strip server-added `who: null` fields so
  round-trips match the user plan.
- `reporting_exporter`, `cloud_backup`: preserve only the user-supplied
  attributes subset; server-side defaults no longer trigger spurious drift.
- `vm_device`: filter server-added attribute keys (e.g. DISPLAY's
  `web_port`) to match the plan.
- `alert_service`: on SCALE 25.10, `type` is now embedded inside
  `attributes` (polymorphic discriminator schema); the top-level `type`
  field introduced in 25.04 has been reverted.
- `dataset`: read `comments` from `user_properties.comments` on SCALE
  25.10 (top-level `comments` field is now always null).

### Changed

- Split `internal/client/client.go` into per-domain files for
  maintainability. `client.go` now contains only the base HTTP client,
  retry/backoff helpers, `APIError`, `Job`/`WaitForJob`, and shared
  common types (`PropertyValue`, `PropertyRawVal`, `Schedule`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- 36 resources + 9 data sources covering the initial expansion wave:
  iSCSI target/portal/extent/initiator/target-extent, CronJob,
  AlertService, Replication, Zvol, User, Group, Tunable, CloudSync,
  RsyncTask, StaticRoute, NetworkConfiguration, InitScript, ScrubTask,
  FilesystemACL, Service, FTP/NFS/SMB/SNMP/SSH/UPS/Mail configs,
  ACME DNS authenticator, API key, Certificate, Keychain credential.
- Per-domain client files co-located with their resource definitions.
- Round-trip test coverage for every resource's Create→Read path.

### Fixed

- `dataset` now round-trips `comments`, `quota`, `refquota`, `sync`,
  `snapdir`, `copies`, `readonly`, and `recordsize` via the
  `PropertyValue`/`PropertyRawVal` indirection the SCALE API uses.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Initial provider implementation supporting TrueNAS SCALE 24.04+.
- API key authentication via `api_key` argument or `TRUENAS_API_KEY`
  environment variable.
- Base URL configuration via `url` argument or `TRUENAS_URL` environment
  variable.
- Built on `terraform-plugin-framework` v1.15.0.
- Initial resources: `dataset`, `share_nfs`, `share_smb`, `snapshot_task`,
  `replication`, `iscsi_portal`, `iscsi_initiator`, `iscsi_extent`,
  `iscsi_target`, `cronjob`, `alert_service`.
- Initial data sources: `dataset`, `pool`, `system_info`.
